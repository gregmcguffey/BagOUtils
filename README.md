# My Ulitimate Bag of Utilities (mubu)
This project is a collection of .NET projects that provide a set of utilities. The utilities are broken up into small, discreet projects, each with a NuGet package. This allows for targeted inclusion of just the necessary utilities in a project. Tools such as ILMerge or [LibZ](https://github.com/MiloszKrajewski/LibZ) can then be used to deal with deploying large number of _dlls_.
